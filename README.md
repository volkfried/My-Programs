Programs I wrote that I want to share with people. 

Programs beginning with the letter "v" are used for vector manipulation, in either the Cartesian x+iy or the polar [radius,angle]. These are useful for calculations involving AC circuits. 
Programs beginning with the letter "x" are useful for determining the resistance, reactance, and impedance of circuit elements in AC circuits. 
Programs beginning with "conf" are used to determine confidence intervals for data sets. 
Programs ending with "2c" are used for manipulation of two's complement signed binary numbers.
